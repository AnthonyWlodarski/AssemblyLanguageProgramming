The smallest addressable unit on a computer is in bytes, adding 1 to an address moves
it to the next byte.

words are two bytes and to move from one address to the next you add two.
double word is a dword, to move from one address to the next you add four.
quad word is a qword, to move from one address to the next you add eight.

Modes determine how we address memory.

Real mode
Real mode flat model
Real mode segmented model
Protected mode flat model

When a program executes it moves through instructions one at a time. One important
exception is an interrupt.  An outside stimulus can cause the normal flow to be interrupted.

1.) Program halts for interrupt
2.) Program status is saved
3.) Interrupt is serviced
4.) Program status is restored
5.) Program resumes
