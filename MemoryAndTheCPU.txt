When working with memory and the CPU you can access memory by it's address.  The largest
value you can address in a 32-bit architecture is 4,294,967,295. You can address spaces
larger than this but this is discussed later.

Registers are used in intel chipsets to address memory.  There are 8/16/32 bit versions
of these registers.  All registers are 32 bits inside.  You can address the whole 32 bits
or the 16 bits.

32-bit name     16-bit name
ESI             SI
EDI             DI
EBP             BP
ESP             SP

E stands for extended or expanded.

There are some additional registers based on size as an example

<--------32 bits -------->
            <---16 bits-->
            <--8--><--8-->

EAX would address the whole register
AX would address the 16 bits
AH would address the high 8 bits
AL would address the low 8 bits

The naming convention is E for extend
X for the lower 16 (hexadecimal...)
H for the high 8 bits
L for the low 8 bits

There are four of these registers A,B,C,D.

BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!

The IP register is a 32-bit register that holds the address of the next instruction to be
executed.  It is a specialized register, it is loaded and executed, at that time it is moved
forward to the new instruction.

CS, DS, SS AND ES registers are the segment registers and are set by the operating system. You
cannot write to them and they determine the 4 gigabytes you can address.

EFLAGS is a collection of named bits and is very important!
