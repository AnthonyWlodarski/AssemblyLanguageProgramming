FLAGS is the 16 bit version of EFLAGS.  This register holds a collection of flag bits.
You address the register one bit at a time.  Various instructions affect the flags in
different ways.  The flags are called condition codes.

OF  overflow flag -> set when the result of an operation is too big in location
SF  sign flag -> set when result of operation is negative HO bit is set to 1
                    subtract two values and check the sign flag
ZF  zero flag -> set when results of operation is zero
                    to see if two numbers you subtract and check this flag
CF  carry flag -> if the results of any arithmetic operation have a carry bit then this
                    flag is set
DF  direction flag -> with the direction set the order of a copy operation can set at the highest
                        to the lowest or the lowest to the highest
IF  interrupt flag ->
TF  trap flag   -> the CPU will only execute a single instruction before it calls an interrupt
                    routine.
AF  aux carry flag  -> uses bcd numbers operations, not really used anymore
PF  parity flag -> in the low order bit if all bits are odd we have this flag set

The other registers are used in legacy chipsets or may not be used at all. Some instructions may
or may not set these flags.
