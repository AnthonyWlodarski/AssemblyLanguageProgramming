Fundamental syntax of a line in ASM

label: instruction operands ; comment

macro is different as syntax is different, when expanded it creates a line of the above form.
\ character is a continuation character

fields are separated by spaces, the colon following the label is optional

mov: mov eax,4 -> valid statement
mov  mov eax,4 -> error

label
label:

The above are both valid.

ALWAYS USE A COLON AND USE THE WARNING MESSAGE FOR LABELS THAT DON'T HAVE COLONS!

Labels can begin with _?.$
Labels are case sensitive

The opcode can be any machine instruction or repeat commands.  Can also be prefixed with size
prefixes 16/32/64

Operands depend on the instruction
    mov eax,17 -> copies 17 into eax register

Effective address is obtained by applying indexing to a specify address.
    mov ax,[blot] will copy the contents at the memory address of blot.
    mov ax,[blot+1] is one byte past blot
    mov ax,[blot+cx]

    mov ax,fish -> constant value or address itself
    mov ax,[fish] -> contents being copied
