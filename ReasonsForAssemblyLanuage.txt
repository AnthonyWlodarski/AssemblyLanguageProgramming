1.) Allows us to avoid writing code in binary directly into the machine.
2.) Reads words and stores them into bits, bits are read and assembles them into their proper form. E.g. "AND AC,37".  Uses mnemonics instead of bit patterns.
3.) If you understand Assembly you will be better at C/C++ and Java as you understand what goes on inside the CPU.
4.) Learn more about how computers work!
5.) Write faster and smaller code compared to compilers, however not as true with modern compiler optimizations.
6.) Directly access hardware from assembly.
7.) Get a better understanding of what the compiler is doing for you.
