db 100 is the define byte instruction.

This defines one byte and stores 100 in it.

db 64h

This is the same way as using db 100

db 17,C4h,"abcd",0x44

This defines multiple bytes in memory

resb 22

Creates a block of 22 bytes with no initial values.

resw 1

Reserves one word of space (2 bytes).

resd
resq
rest
reso
resy

All examples of reserved space words.

If you would like to use binary files you can do the following

image: incbin "flower.jpg"

By default the entire file is included.

audio: incbin "brock.au", 1024

The above will skip over the first 1024 bytes.

bark: incbin "dog.au",250,300

This will start at 250 bytes but then stop at 300 bytes so including only 50 bytes.

level equ 34

The above tells the assembler to equate 34 with the label "level"

locate equ $

The dollar sign has a double meaning, it is the address of the current location. You
can use dollar signs in the beginning of the string.

string: db "hello, world",10
length equ $-string

The above sets the label length to the memory address of the current value minus the string.
