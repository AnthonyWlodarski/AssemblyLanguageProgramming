Shifting bits to the left one position multiplies them by two, e.g.

0110 > 1100 = 6 * 2 = 12 which is 1100 in binary.

Shifting bits the right is the same as division, e.g.

0100 > 0010 = 4/2 which is 2 which is 0010 in binary.

Addition of binary numbers

When you encounter two 1 values being added you must carry a bit to the left (0 carry 1). Otherwise
you just add 1 and 0 normally.

0001
1100 +

1101

Subtraction of numbers using two's compliment.

0110 - 0010

You take the compliment of the second number

1101 and add 1 to it, i.e. 1110 thus getting the two's compliment. Then you add it to the
original number.

0110
1110 +
----
10100

When given an overflow bit we simply discard the bit.  Thus we arrive at 0100 which is 4.
